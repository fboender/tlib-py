"""
The graph module allows you to use Graph data structures. A graph has nodes and
edges which connect the various nodes. A range of operations can be performed
on the data structures such as walking the graph, doing dependency resolution
and finding the shortest path.

Example:

>>> g = Graph()
>>> g.add_node('php')
>>> g.add_node('apache')
>>> g.add_node('pear')
>>> g.add_node('wordpress')
>>> g.add_node('genshi')
>>> g.add_edge('wordpress', 'pear')
>>> g.add_edge('genshi', 'wordpress')
>>> g.add_edge('pear', 'php')
>>> g.add_edge('php', 'apache')
>>> g.resolve('wordpress')
['apache', 'php', 'pear', 'wordpress']
